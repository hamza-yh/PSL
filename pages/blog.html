            <h2 class="fade-up">Hey everyone,<br><br>

                We are excited to announce that <b>“SKATE”</b> by DG the Artist is the official theme song of the PSL for Season 1. We believe 
                this to be a part of our overall direction of a league being made by cubers, for cubers.<br><br>
                
                His song perfectly encapsulates the epic energy we aim to achieve here in the PSL. If you’ve purchased tickets, be ready 
                to jam out with us in-person on March 16th! If you cannot, you can party with us virtually by tuning into the broadcasts 
                on SpeedcubingTV. <br><br>
