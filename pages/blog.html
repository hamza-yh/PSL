             <h2 class="fade-up">Hey everyone, here are some MAJOR announcements for PSL as an organization, 
             as well as our upcoming event in Las Vegas on September 1st! <br><br>

            <b>1)  GFuel Energy Partnership</b><br>
            We are happy to announce that the GFuel energy is the official hydration partner of the PSL!
             You can use discount code “PSL” at <a href="https://gfuel.com/psl">https://gfuel.com/psl</a> and save 20% off your next order.
              Have you seen those Rubik’s tumblers? They are totally worth getting! How will you choose to rep the brand?<br><br>

           <b>2) Divisions</b><br>
            We are implementing beginners, intermediate and pro divisions starting at Vegas Sep 1. This
             is because we want to create an environment of higher and personalized participation at PSL
              that is able to still draw from a head-to-head format.<br><br>


            <b>3) Opening FREE competing to everyone</b><br>
            With this division implementation, we decided to open up free competing registration to everyone!
             If you are interested in competing at the PSL but was previously intimidated by the skillcap, check
              it out! We want everyone to have fun.<br><br>


            <b>4) Venue Change</b><br>
            We are moving the event to Downtown Container Park. An outdoor festival shopping mall venue with
             plenty of food, entertainment and amenities. Check them out on instagram if you want an idea of what
              it looks like - we don't think you'll be disappointed! This venue will be open to all spectators since 
              there will be plenty of noncubers hovering the space. Therefore, anyone who has purchased a spectator
               ticket will be refunded and offered to compete instead. <br><br>

            We are still looking to improve the symbiotic experience of a league and one thing we are specifically
             looking at is the relationship between divisions. You'll see that the winner of the intermediate division 
             will be able to go on stream against the pros - if anyone has ideas similar to that to provide rewards
              to intermediate or beginners divisions, let us know via the proper feedback channels! Stay tuned for
               upcoming events and register for PSL Vegas at <a href="https://start.gg/pslv/register">https://start.gg/pslv/register</a> <br><br>

            <h2 class="fade-up">Hey everyone,<br><br>

                The PSL is excited to announce that we are offering attendees discounts for coaching services from <a href="https://cubing.life">Cubing Life Academy</a>

            <h2 class="fade-up">Hey everyone,<br><br>

                We are excited to announce that <b>“SKATE”</b> by DG the Artist is the official theme song of the PSL for Season 1. We believe 
                this to be a part of our overall direction of a league being made by cubers, for cubers.<br><br>
                
                His song perfectly encapsulates the epic energy we aim to achieve here in the PSL. If you’ve purchased tickets, be ready 
                to jam out with us in-person on March 16th! If you cannot, you can party with us virtually by tuning into the broadcasts 
                on SpeedcubingTV. <br><br>
