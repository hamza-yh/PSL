        <h2>The Premier Speedcubers’ League is home to the highest standard of competitive speedcubers and cubing entertainment. Here, you’ll see some of the best-ever solves recorded on the rubik’s cube, coupled with our state-of-the-art innovation in statistics, hardware, software, broadcasting and content creation. <br><br>

            We are featuring 6 in-person invitational events that are a part of our “PSL Tour”. Capping off our competitive season will be the “PSL Tour Championship” where we crown our Grand Champion, the winner of the league and a coveted cash prize of TBD. <br><br>
            
            Every season, we will be featuring our partners and athletes. This season, look out for Dylan Miller, Matty Hiroto Inaba and TBD as official athletes of the PSL. Who will you be rooting for, and which free agent will be the next one to step up to the plate?</h2>
